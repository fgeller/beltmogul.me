  For a bit more than a year I have been working mainly with Scala in
  Emacs. While it's not like working with a LISP, there are a few tweaks that
  make life a bit easier. I'll describe my setup and the small additions that
  work for me.  There's only very little Emacs Lisp, but you can always find
  more details on [[https://github.com/fgeller/emacs.d][fgeller/emacs.d]].

  As a caveat, while I used [[https://github.com/aemoncannon/ensime][aemoncannon/ensime]] heavily in the beginning, I
  rarely switch it on nowadays, mostly due to the overhead with sub projects in
  SBT. Instead I use other tools to get similar functionality. These tools are
  not as tightly integrated with Scala, but that also means many are applicable
  for other scenarios as well. Also, none of this is meant as a reference, but
  more as pointers -- I'm always curious to learn about other techniques :)

  Entry point is usually the project root via an alias in =eshell= to set the
  =default-directory=. Then I'll start a SBT session via =compile= in =comint-mode= to
  run tests and drive compilation (e.g., via an alias for =(compile "sbt" t)= in
  =eshell=).

  I use [[https://github.com/magit/magit][magit/magit]] for getting a basic overview of where I left off or to create a
  new branch. Then there are multiple options to find a file to edit. Either
  jump to a specific line in a file with uncommitted changes via the hunk in
  =magit-status=, or browse the log and jump via a commit, or browse current files
  under version control via [[https://github.com/emacs-helm/helm-ls-git][emacs-helm/helm-ls-git]].

  I use [[https://github.com/hvesalai/scala-mode2][hvesalai/scala-mode2]] for basic syntax highlighting plus
  [[https://github.com/drothlis/pretty-symbols][drothlis/pretty-symbols]] for two more unicode glyphs ;)

  In the background, there is usually a process running for formatting files via
  [[https://github.com/mdr/scalariform][mdr/scalariform]] that I connect to by adding to the =after-save-hook=. It's a
  small [[https://github.com/fgeller/scalariform-daemon][fgeller/scalariform-daemon]] that waits for HTTP requests and formats
  files in place.  This means that I lose undo history but that hasn't been an
  issue for me. I tried magit's integration with [[https://github.com/bartman/git-wip][bartman/git-wip]], but very
  rarely used it. Most importantly, it saves time to start up the JVM for each
  format request and combined with a low value for =auto-revert-interval= you get
  quick formats on save.

  [[https://github.com/magnars/expand-region.el/][magnars/expand-region.el]] and [[https://github.com/Fuco1/smartparens][Fuco1/smartparens]] enable a light version of
  structured editing, but mostly there is little special configuration for
  editing Scala code versus general text editing. There are tons of cool
  [[http://emacsrocks.com/][resources]] out there that do a much better job at describing [[https://github.com/capitaomorte/yasnippet][snippets]],
  [[https://github.com/auto-complete/auto-complete][auto-completion]] or [[https://github.com/winterTTr/ace-jump-mode][quick in buffer jumping]] and more :)

  SBT's [[http://www.scala-sbt.org/release/docs/Detailed-Topics/Triggered-Execution][triggered execution]] via the tilde operator is usually my main driver
  during development for red-green-refactor. Using compile-mode to run the SBT
  session enables jumping to specific lines on compilation or test failure.

  For other navigation I use a combination of tags and basic text search. For
  tags, I configure [[http://ctags.sourceforge.net/][Exuberant ctags]] as a plug-in parser for [[http://www.gnu.org/software/global/global.html][GNU global]]. ctags
  allows me to simply add a basic regex-based [[https://gist.github.com/fgeller/8452095][configuration]] for Scala files and
  global allows for incremental updates on save. I also add other sources to my
  projects to enable jumping to tags in other libraries or the Scala
  distribution for reference. [[https://github.com/syohex/emacs-helm-gtags][helm-gtags]] allows for convenient selection between
  multiple candidates by matching on the source line or file name. I also copied
  helm-gtags functionality for a [[https://github.com/fgeller/emacs.d/blame/master/init.org#L1635][crude helper]] to create import statements based
  on indexed tags.

  Finally, for in-buffer search there is the excellent built-in [[http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/IncrementalSearch][isearch]] but for
  text searches across files I use [[https://github.com/Wilfred/ag.el][Wilfred/ag.el]] as a front-end for
  [[https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher][ggreer/the_silver_searcher]]. As a bonus, you get easy text changes across files
  via [[https://github.com/mhayashi1120/Emacs-wgrep][mhayashi1120/Emacs-wgrep]].
