Emacs Lisp and the ability to hack Emacs like a REPL on steroids is probably
Emacs' greatest feature from my perspective. I enjoy the immediacy of hacking
Emacs in Emacs every time. As I started to clean up my
[[https://github.com/fgeller/emacs.d/][.emacs.d]] recently, I enjoyed writing a
couple of extensions myself. This post introduces each one briefly. Maybe some
of these extensions are useful to you as well or trigger your interest to hack
on some yourself :)

* basic theme

As I started with a clean slate, I didn't have major modes installed for some of
the languages I work with daily. Funnily enough, I enjoyed the lack of colors
and am still practicing abstinence today ;) Controversial I bet, but it works
for me at the moment. I generally try to reduce the UI noise, much like
Bastien's [[http://bzg.fr/emacs-strip-tease.html][#Emacs, naked]]. I wrote the
minimal [[https://github.com/fgeller/basic-theme.el][fgeller/basic-theme.el]] to
accomodate this. Here's the =*scratch*= buffer after startup:

#+ATTR_HTML: :alt basic theme: scratch buffer :title basic theme: scratch buffer
[[file:../../img/o/basic-scratch.png][file:../../img/o/basic-scratch-resized.png]]

Not much changes visually when editing Emacs Lisp:

#+ATTR_HTML: :alt basic theme: Emacs Lisp :title basic theme: Emacs Lisp
[[file:../../img/o/basic-emacs-lisp.png][file:../../img/o/basic-emacs-lisp-resized.png]]

Notice that the mode-line is nearly entirely hidden. I use a little helper to
make it visible from time to time. Check out
[[https://github.com/fgeller/basic-theme.el][fgeller/basic-theme.el]] for the
basic idea.

* highlight-thing

While I disable the =font-lock= machinery globally to prevent syntax
highlighting, the UI is not fully monochrome. Certain elements are still
colorized to facilitate reading and finding patterns.

One package I used previously is the excellent
[[https://github.com/nschum/highlight-symbol.el][nschum/highlight-symbol.el]]
that highlights the symbol under point and the other occurrences of it in the
current buffer. However, it relies on =font-lock= for highlighting, which I'm
trying to get around. So I wrote a very simple global minor mode that does just
this, highlight the current symbol or word under point:
[[https://github.com/fgeller/highlight-thing.el][fgeller/highlight-thing.el]].

#+ATTR_HTML: :alt highlight-thing :title highlight-thing
[[file:../../img/o/highlight-thing.png][file:../../img/o/highlight-thing-resized.png]]

This allows me to quickly find occurrences of a variable or function name. The
minor mode uses only built-in functionality and is very lightweight (~50 lines
of code). There are plenty of solutions that are more sophisticated
(e.g. [[https://github.com/nschum/highlight-symbol.el][nschum/highlight-symbol.el]]
which also adds helpers for navigation, or
[[https://github.com/boyw165/hl-anything][boyw165/hl-anything]] which introduces
more detail control over what to highlight when and how to get around multiple
highlights conflicting with each other), but I enjoy the simplicity of
=highlight-thing=.

* fingers

The last extension is the result of trying multiple other modes to get around
the infamous pinky or modifier problem. I had used
[[https://github.com/chrisdone/god-mode][chrisdone/god-mode]] happily for a
while: It allows for a comfortable transition to modal editing. When enabled,
all commands that require the control modifier =C-= are available as if =C-= was
pressed. So to move point a line up and then down again you can press =pn=
rather than =C-p C-n=. Other prefixes like =M-= and =C-M-= are also conveniently
accessible via the =g= and =G= prefix.

I recently tried [[https://github.com/jyp/boon][jyp/boon]] which requires a
bigger step by introducing entirely new bindings for navigation and text
manipulation. Rather than relying on Emacs' bindings that are mostly based on
mnemonics, =boon= adds key bindings that are organized with ergonomics in mind
and several helpful text manipulation commands. For example, navigation commands
are bound to your right hand: home row allows for navigation within a line, the
top row allows for navigation across lines. I enjoyed the ideas quite a bit, but
found it rather hard to extend =boon=. It is optimized for the Colemak keyboard
layout and I found [[https://github.com/fgeller/boon/commits/workman][no easy
mapping mechanism]].

Standing on the shoulders of both giants, I wrote
[[https://github.com/fgeller/fingers.el][fgeller/fingers.el]]. It combines ideas
from both =god-mode= and =boon=. For example, navigation and text manipulation
is split between right and left hand like for =boon= and you can access commands
that require the =M-= prefix similarly to =god-mode=. =fingers-mode= has no
external dependencies and I try to limit the bindings to what is generally
applicable. This is a short demo of some of the text manipulation commands as
discussed in the README:

#+ATTR_HTML: :alt fingers-mode :title fingers-mode :width 500px
[[file:../../img/o/fingers-mode.gif][file:../../img/o/fingers-mode.gif]]

The README contains more details and examples and I added mappings for Qwerty
and Neo, so maybe give it a try and let me know what you think :)

* publish

All three can be installed by cloning the respective repository and adding it to
your =load-path= manually. [[https://github.com/fgeller/fingers.el][fingers.el]]
is already available via [[http://melpa.milkbox.net:1337/#/fingers][MELPA]], and
the other two packages may soon be available too.

If you're curious, the process of adding a package to MELPA was straight-forward
and smooth:

 - Fork [[https://github.com/milkypostman/melpa][milkypostman/melpa]]
 - Add a recipe of the form
   #+begin_src emacs-lisp
     (name :fetcher github :repo "fgeller/name.el")
   #+end_src
 - Package it locally:
   #+begin_src sh
     make recipes/name
   #+end_src
 - Inspect and install it locally in a sandbox:
   #+begin_src emacs-lisp
     EMACS=~/bin/emacs make sandbox
   #+end_src
 - Commit to a new branch and push it to your fork
 - Create a pull request against upstream.
 - Voilà!

That's it, happy Emacs hacking :)
