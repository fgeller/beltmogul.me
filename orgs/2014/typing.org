   This post is a summary of the tools that I'm fiddling with to tweak my
   keyboard layout every now and then. I recently changed from [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dvorak_Simplified_Keyboard][Dvorak]] to the
   less standard [[http://www.workmanlayout.com/blog/][Workman Layout]] with a bit more exotic features that led me to
   look into options for implementing and customizing the layout.

* OSX

   For my Macbook, new layouts can be added by creating a bundle in
   =~/Library/Keyboard Layouts=. There is a Workman bundle with several layout
   variations available at [[https://github.com/deekayen/workman/tree/master/mac][deekayen/workman]]. I'm using a variation of [[https://github.com/deekayen/workman/tree/master/mac#workman-dead-for-programmers][Workman
   Dead]], which trades the number of key presses against the distance
   traveled. Additionally, you don't have to press a modifier key to get to the
   symbols. Symbols that are usually available via the number row, are
   accessible on home row after pressing the dead key. Pressing the dead key, in
   my case the comma key, will remap several keys. It changes the layout from
   normal Workman:

   #+ATTR_HTML: :alt workman layer. :title workman layer.
   [[file:../../img/o/Screen-Shot-2014-08-09-at-7.45.47-AM.png][file:../../img/o/Screen-Shot-2014-08-09-at-7.45.47-AM-resized.png]]

   to a more symbol focused one:

   #+ATTR_HTML: :alt symbol layer. :title symbol layer.
   [[file:../../img/o/Screen-Shot-2014-08-09-at-7.45.52-AM.png][file:../../img/o/Screen-Shot-2014-08-09-at-7.45.52-AM-resized.png]]

   For example, the key ={= is accessible by pressing
   @@html:<code>@@,s@@html:</code>@@ in succession, rather than =shift= + =[=, the
   key =(= is @@html:<code>@@,h@@html:</code>@@ rather than =shift= + =9= and so on.

   The symbol layer is different from the one included in the bundle at
   [[https://github.com/deekayen/workman/tree/master/mac][deekayen/workman]], more customized to my habits. For example, rather than
   splitting parentheses across both hands, I moved them to the left hand. This
   means that the right hand can stay on top of the dead key in case I want to
   insert a pair. I also traded numbers for more symbols and added =~= close to
   the dead key so that I can type =~/= conveniently in a rolling motion.

   The customization is quite straight forward with [[http://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id%3Dnrsi&id%3Dukelele][Ukelele]]. You can open the
   main bundle, select the layout you want to modify and enter the symbol layer
   to modify just that part of it. Ukelele then updates the file that describes
   the layout (=*.keylayout= in =Workman.bundle/Contents/Resources=). Much more
   convenient than editing the XML by hand :)

  For some specific key remapping on my Macbook I use [[https://pqrs.org/osx/karabiner/][Karabiner]] and [[https://pqrs.org/osx/karabiner/seil.html.en][Seil]], rather
  than the layout. For example, capslock and return are both mapped to control
  when pressed in combination with another key, otherwise to their original
  meaning. The combination of Karabiner and Seil allows all sorts of
  remappings. For example, in the firmware version I mapped backslash to the
  capslock key, as I don't really use capslock. I use Seil to map capslock to
  backslash and Karabiner to map backslash to control when pressed in
  combination with another key.

  You can do this for any other key combo: Identify the key's code via:
  Karabiner > Misc & Uninstall > Launch EventViewer and use Seil to map the
  capslock key to that code. Then add your own configuration to Karabiner,
  similar to the following:

   #+begin_src xml
     <?xml version="1.0"?>
     <root>
       <item>
         <name>Change backslash to left control key.</name>
         <appendix>(Send an backslash key event when backslash key is pressed alone.)</appendix>
         <identifier>private.backslash_to_control_escape</identifier>

         <autogen>
           __KeyOverlaidModifier__
           <!-- from -->
           KeyCode::BACKSLASH,
           <!-- to -->
           KeyCode::CONTROL_L,
           <!-- alone -->
           KeyCode::BACKSLASH,
         </autogen>
       </item>
     </root>
   #+end_src

   The software support that OSX offers is quite convenient and switching
   between layouts is fast, in case someone else needs to type. But there are
   some shortcomings:

   - OSX defaults back to QWERTY when requesting an admin password or when
     logging out.

   - There are some issues with the symbol layers when using sites like
     [[http://www.keybr.com/][keybr.com]] or [[https://typing.io/][typing.io]] for practicing. Not sure where the key presses are
     lost or whether they are translated incorrectly.

   - When pairing with other developers, I fall back to Qwerty as Workman is
     still quite niche and few systems support it out of the box.

* ErgoDox

   Hardware to the rescue! I bought an [[http://ergodox.org/][ErgoDox]] via [[https://www.massdrop.com/buy/ergodox?s%3Dergodox][Massdrop]] last year and this
   seemed like the perfect opportunity to learn about its firmware. Compiling my
   own firmware version addresses the above issues by "escaping" OSX and
   allowing me to just plug in a keyboard with Workman installed. There are
   multiple firmware implementations available and I just customized one to fit
   my needs. This means custom placement of modifier keys and also adding the
   dead key layer. I'm using Massdrop's configurator for the ErgoDox to get a
   visual representation of my setup:

   #+ATTR_HTML: :alt ergodox layer 0. :title ergodox layer 0.
   [[file:../../img/o/ergodox-layer-0.png][file:../../img/o/ergodox-layer-0-resized.png]]

   This is just the first layer, the next layer is for symbols and the third is
   for a numpad on the right hand near home row, the full configuration is
   available [[https://www.massdrop.com/ext/ergodox/?referer%3D92TGQH&hash%3Dcd06f0925f6a7563b492b5fcfb08f7a7][here]].

   The configurator allows you to compile your own firmware version as well, but
   currently there is no support for the dead key approach that I'm using. But
   luckily [[https://github.com/benblazak/ergodox-firmware][benblazak/ergodox-firmware]] has support for sticky keys, which you can
   use to implement the dead key approach. The project is well documented and
   it's quite straight-forward to compile your own version on a Mac. The only
   external dependency I had to download was the compiler as part of the [[http://www.obdev.at/products/crosspack/download.html][AVR
   MacPack]]. Change the layout in =src/makefile-options= to your target and you're
   good to go! Simply issue a =make= in the =src= sub-folder and then load the
   resulting =firmware.hex= with a [[http://pjrc.com/teensy/loader_mac.html][Teensy Loader]] onto your ErgoDox.

   To implement a Workman Dead version, I used the existing [[https://github.com/benblazak/ergodox-firmware/blob/master/src/keyboard/ergodox/layout/colemak-jc-mod.c][Colemak layout]] that
   makes use of the sticky keys functionality and adapted the keys to
   Workman. The layout definition is split across three function invocations,
   where each one looks similar to the following:

   #+begin_src c
     const uint8_t PROGMEM _kb_layout[KB_LAYERS][KB_ROWS][KB_COLUMNS] = {
     // LAYER 0
     KB_MATRIX_LAYER(
         // unused
         0,
         // left hand
         _esc,       _1, _2, _3, _4, _5, _grave,
         0,          _Q, _D, _R, _W, _B, _tab,
         _backslash, _A, _S, _H, _T, _G,
         _shiftL,    _Z, _X, _M, _C, _V, _guiL,
         0,          0,  0,  0,  _esc,
         // left thumb block
              0, 0,
         0,   0, _altL,
         _bs, 2, _ctrlL,
         // right hand
         _equal, _6, _7, _8, _9,      _0,         _esc,
         _dash,  _J, _F, _U, _P,      _semicolon, 0,
                 _Y, _N, _E, _O,      _I,         _quote,
         _guiR,  _K, _L, 1,  _period, _slash,     _shiftR,
                 _arrowU, _arrowD, _arrowL, _arrowR, 0,
         // right thumb block
         0,      0,
         _altR,  0,      0,
         _ctrlR, _enter, _space
     ),
   #+end_src

   The above snippet is the definition for the first layer and defines the basic
   Workman layout. The =0='s indicate an unused key while the ones with an
   underscore reference a given key code. For example, =_9= refers to the key code
   that a regular USB keyboard emits when you press the =9= key (I'm using the
   short name, the full name is more descriptive: =KEY_9_LeftParenthesis=).

   To implement the symbol layer, I use the comma key as a sticky key, wish
   activates a second layer (for one key press). The definition of the sticky
   keys is straight-forward: You indicate the layer number on the normal layout
   (the =1= in comma position and =2= on the left thumb block in the basic layout
   above).

   In addition to the call to =_kb_layout=, you manage the specific behavior for
   press & release by passing mappings to =_kb_layout_press= and
   =_kb_layout_release=. These mappings are analogous to the one passed to
   =_kb_layout=, but instead of key codes you add references to functions. For the
   activation of the symbol layer, you add references to =lsticky1= or =lsticky2= in
   the press & and release mappings.

   Not all symbols are accessible without modifiers on a regular keyboard, but
   one goal of the dead key approach is to get rid of the modifier. For this to
   work, you can supply a modifier-specific function in the press & release
   mapping. For example, this is just the layout for the left hand for the
   symbol layer:

   #+begin_src c
     0,  0,          0,          0,          0,          0,      0,
     0,  _bracketR,  _bracketR,  _0,         _add_kp,    _2,     0,
     0,  _bracketL,  _bracketL,  _9,         _equal_kp,  _5,
     0,  _comma,     _period,    _backslash, _dash,      _dash,  0,
     0,  0,          0,          0,          0,
   #+end_src

   To produce ={}= rather than =[]= in the third column, the press & release
   mappings contain calls to =kbfun_shift_press_release= (aka =sshprre=) rather than
   the normal =kbfun_press_release= (aka =kprrel=):

   #+begin_src c
    ktrans,	ktrans,		ktrans,		ktrans,		ktrans,		ktrans,		ktrans,
    ktrans,	kprrel,		sshprre,	sshprre,	sshprre,	sshprre,	ktrans,
    ktrans,	kprrel,		sshprre,	sshprre,	sshprre,	sshprre,
    ktrans,	sshprre,	sshprre,	sshprre,	kprrel,		sshprre,	ktrans,
    ktrans,	ktrans,		ktrans,		ktrans,		ktrans,
   #+end_src

   The tedious bit is to keep the corresponding calls to =_kb_layout_press= and
   =_kb_layout_release= for each layer in sync. Otherwise you might see modifier
   keys that remain pressed for no apparent reason. For example, if the press &
   release mappings contain different function references, one to =kprrel= and the
   other to =sshprre=, then the shift modifier would not get released properly.
   Keeping the different invocations in sync is a bit tedious as all information
   is passed in a single call where position defines the meaning of a value and
   you only get arity compiler warnings. But your favorite editor might be able
   to help you with that ;)
